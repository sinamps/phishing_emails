I saw this one coming. Assume no, right? 

If a laugh will help get it, here's the award for most obnoxious reply yet:

Kenny and Katherine,

Thanks so much for the invite. Unfortunately we've got a prior obligation that night for a friend's birthday dinner. (And we went to that State Dinner last week, so I think Obama's pretty tired of us by now anyway.)

Seems like just yesterday that Ben was telling me about talking to candidate Obama about Thrillist in his childhood bedroom during that first fundraiser. Time flies...

Thanks again and hope to see you soon.

Best,
Ricky and Allison

Do you have the time for the 8th?
