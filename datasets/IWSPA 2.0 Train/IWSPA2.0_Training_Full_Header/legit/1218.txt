DPNM Releases Statement Ahead of New Mexico GOP State Convention

Albuquerque, N.M. =96 The Democratic Party of New Mexico (DPNM) released th=
e following statement ahead of the New Mexico GOP State Convention:

=93The New Mexico GOP severely mismanaged the logistics for news outlets fo=
r their state convention, which is an indication that their organization do=
es not value the importance the press plays in our election process. On top=
 of that, the fact that the New Mexico GOP endorsed Donald Trump for presid=
ent, and their highest ranking Republican official, Governor Susana Martine=
z, has refused to endorse Trump, exemplifies chaos in the Republican Party,=
 in our state, and across the country.

=93Make no mistake, the New Mexico GOP will work to elect Trump as the next=
 United States President, which shows a vehement disregard for the interest=
s of our communities. As we move forward in this election, we can expect to=
 see Republican candidates up and down the ballot taking on Trump=92s harmf=
ul positions toward Hispanic communities, women, and our international alli=
es.=94
[<<link>>]
Over the past two weeks the New Mexico GOP has made headlines for restricti=
ng press access to their convention=97initially announcing a $100 fee for r=
eporters and then retracting the fee after backlash from New Mexico=92s pre=
ss community. And just this week, New Mexico GOP announced that press would=
 not be allowed at their event and later retracted the statement after Sand=
ia Pueblo approved press coverage on their property.
