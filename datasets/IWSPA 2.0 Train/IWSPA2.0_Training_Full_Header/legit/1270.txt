Senate GOP leaders will meet with Trump this week<<<link>>>

<<link>>

Senate Republican leaders will meet with presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday, according to aides on Capitol Hill.

Trump will meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his team at 11:45 a.m. that day, as Trump sweeps through Washington to meet with House Speaker Paul Ryan. McConnell offered Trump a tepid endorsement last week, saying he'll support the nominee but expects Trump lead the effort to unify the party.
