I don't know who is the new Sean so sending to you. The Hill just called ab=
out a piece on DWS & Sanders back and forth. I did, everyone is heated. Cri=
ticism is unfair. Party is fair. She's an easy scapegoat for campaigns that=
 are floundering. Democratically elected chair, etc.

I gave her Eric Walker's info. She said she called/emailed User but hadn't =
heard back.

Just FYI.

Holly
