Hey Sri,

We are putting together a Democratic Lawyers Council reception in NYC with Robbie Kaplan hosting and Gloria Allred featured as the special guest. The ever would take place the evening of Tuesday, May 31st. Per Tina and Kaplan's conversation below, Tina is happy to join if we can work out the timing.

Happy to put her on a flight out of NYC the evening of the 31st or first thing on the 1st. Please let us know at your earliest convenience if this is feasible. It is a women's issues and civil rights focused event, so Tina's participation would be pivotal to the event's success.

Thanks and we Look forwarding to hearing from you.
