I would like to be on this call, but first, I don't think we even need a statement. We just need something to cover ourselves.

I think when we start getting inquiries, if we have a letter to the SOS that we can point to, it will show that we are engaged and that we don't just pipe up when it's a Republican administration closing poll locations.

We can make the point to reporters individually off the record that it's not apples and oranges: Arizona more serious because the state was covered under VRA and has had a history of problems - Rhode Island doesn't have those same historical issues.

Adding Lauren who mentioned this in the morning meeting.

I think it's a good idea to check in with Nellie as well.  Pratt, do you want to do that call together?

I am fine with that.  Before we do that we should talk to the SOS to get all of the details.

Was thinking a letter so that if press asks us about it, we can show we are responsive and active. If we're crying foul in AZ, we might need to do the same - at least nominally - in RI so we don't look like hypocrites
