OrganizationStatement on Republican Senator Admitting Senate Republicans Should do =
Their Job on Supreme Court

WASHINGTON - OrganizationChair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued the following s=
tatement on Senator Jeff Flake's comments on Meet the Press today that if R=
epublicans lose the presidential election they "ought to approve [Chief Jud=
ge Garland] quickly:"

"Senator Flake's comments today are a reminder that Republicans are playing=
 political games with the Supreme Court. Chief Judge Garland is the most qu=
alified nominee to immediately serve on the Supreme Court with more federal=
 judicial experpience than any other nominee in history, America=92s histor=
y and as the Constitution requires, he should get a fair hearing and a vote=
. That the GOP has nominated a reckless and dangerous candidate in Donald T=
rump who lacks the temperament and judgment to serve -- much less appoint a=
 Supreme Court justice -- should be enough for Republicans in the Senate to=
 do their job now, not domain.com till November."
