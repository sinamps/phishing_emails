Trump with Lester Holt:

Not sure endorsements matter
- But Bobby Knight helped me win big in Indiana

Stands by Muslim ban
- We have to be vigilant
- Look at what's happening with the migration in Europe
- Urgent problem

Stands by mass deportation
- But they can come back in through a process

Dragging Bill Clinton in?
- I'd like to see a "high level policy oriented" campaign

General election funding:
- I have nothing to do with the Super PAC
- work with the RNC to raise money
- at least $1 billion, maybe even over that
