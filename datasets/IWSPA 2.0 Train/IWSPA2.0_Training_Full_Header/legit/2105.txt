Plus others. I think we should point out that it's a state party event so that we'd have to refer them back to the state party. We don't want to own the chaos. But we might have to say something more broadly about the process. What do others think?

Hi Mark,

Hope all is well. Was checking to see if you can give me a comment about the chaos at the Nevada state convention over the weekend and the treatement of Roberta Lange, the party chairwoman there, by Sanders supporters. I'm interested in what this means for party unity as the convention approaches.

Thx,
Alan
