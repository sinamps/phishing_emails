The overall domain.com for tonight’s Think Like A Man, Too screening is strong at 6:1. At the filmmaker screening it was 6:1 overall before the screening, but this dropped to 5:1 based on the overwhelming turnout. 



There are no surprises as far as why people are accepting invites – most everyone who saw the first film is excited to see the sequel. Older females, the biggest portion of our audience on the first film, has certainly been the most enthusiastic for our two screenings thus far. 



Overall – 6:1

Males Under 25 – 9:1 

Females Under 25 – 7:1 

Males Over 25 – 6:1

Females Over 25 – 4:1
