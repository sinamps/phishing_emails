We'll keep it at millions for now. We're prepping a basic text to turn into a Medium post, which we would publish from either Brad or Amy.

Confirmed that there is $9,250,945.99 AFTER EXPENSES in HVF that will be transferred to state parties, and $3,077,726.13 allocated for the OrganizationAFTER EXPENSES that will be transferred. .

So they are definitely wrong and we can say that.

If you want to push out those specific numbers though, you should confirm with Schwerin that HFA is comfortable.

Yes. We can debunk. While money has obviously been spent for fundraising costs (which is absolutely necessary in order to raise the 60 million dollars they keep referencing!) there are millions of dollars still sitting in HVF that are allocated to the Organizationand the state parties (and therefore have to be transferred to the Organizationand the state parties) that have not yet been distributed because the point of the party portion of HVF is to raise money to fund the general election. This isn't right and it seems to me that we should say that. Let me reach out to see if I can get hard numbers on how much is left.
