At around 830

-          Doesn't blame the media like Cruz does

-          Voter registration and turnout is up significantly, especially in battleground states

-          Not a lot to be excited about in the Dem race

-          Bernie might not have the delegates because they have a "rigged, subsidized system"

-          If Trump doesn't get the delegates we'll go to an open convention

-          Stick the rules in an open convention

-          Whoever gets 1237, the RNC steps in and you become the presumptive nominee

-          RNC has been focused on 2015 general for four years, this is good news for our  candidates

-          Digital operation is "second to none"
