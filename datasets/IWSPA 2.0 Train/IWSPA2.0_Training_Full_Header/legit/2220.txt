So my colleague Gabe Debenedeti and I are using today=92s quarterly meeting=
 in Phili as a time peg. We=92re canvassing as many top Dems as possible (s=
tate chairs, exec directors) to get a sense of what the big topics of discu=
ssion in Phili are and if the recent events in Nevada came up. I=92m just l=
ooking to talk for 4 or 5 minutes max. Is that at all possible?
