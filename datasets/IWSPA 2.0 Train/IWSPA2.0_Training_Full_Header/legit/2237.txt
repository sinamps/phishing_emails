Hey team - follow-ups from the call.

Research is working their way through the Trump narrative.
I'm working on a skeleton release / advisory for state parties.
Digital is working on products as well.

I already see statements trickling into my inbox. RACHEL please identify an intern to start compiling these - Regional staff please start feeding these responses from state parties (and any clips that come with them) to the intern.

Finally, please stay on top of your battleground states to get events off the ground this week. Don't be mean, but implore them that it is our responsibility as the Democratic Party to hold Trump accountable and make sure he doesn't get into office. Also - it's easy/good press.

Thanks team

Eric Walker
