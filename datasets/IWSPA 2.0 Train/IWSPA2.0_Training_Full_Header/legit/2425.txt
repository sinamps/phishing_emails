show amy good new trailers as soon as they break

adam sign up for google alerts for all of amy's priorities -- amazing spider-man 2, bond, etc...maybe also a few key pieces of talent who are super important to her -- angie, fincher, vince gilligan. im just guessing you guys should make the list together. then adam can filter and pass on the important info as it breaks.
morning headlines in the am -- not too much but just anything interesting from top websites that she can scan on her way into the office (if she's not driving)
