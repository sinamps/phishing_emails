Chuck this guy runs the small business interest group here in dc. They have a bunch of business people who want to give.  They called the hq but no one got back to them. Can you give this guy a call and introduce yourself.

Thanks.

Jordan,

Can you also put me in touch with the West cost Clinton fundraiser.  And remind Alex from NE to get in touch with me.

Good talking to you.
