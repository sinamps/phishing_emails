Hi Pablo -
Thanks for the ideas and meeting today.
When do you think I can expect a Communications Surrogate List?
Attached is the template with the required fields needed for surrogates.
Let your team know they can find home addresses on VoteBuilder.
To meet deadlines on my end, I'd like roughly 200 contacts/talkers (roughly 20 surrogates per team member) by NOON May 19.
I can always check to see if a person is already in the database or answer any questions.
If that's going to be an issue, let's talk ASAP to discuss priorities with the bosses.
Thank you in advance.
