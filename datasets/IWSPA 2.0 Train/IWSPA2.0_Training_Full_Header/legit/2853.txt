Invite attached here!

Does Tina have preferred timing?  It is an evening event, but we are flexible on the time.

Jordan- just got approval from counsel! 

Counsel will need to review and approve the invite and any other materials with her name on it.  Her name should not be on the same page as anything asking for donations (including lists of prices to attend).

Once you have a more firm idea about timing, I am happy to send you flight times that would work. Thanks you!  

Thanks!
Sri
