Gents: Asked around. Costa is domain.com. The station is a mom & pop NorCal stat=
ion with a large, dedicated regional following. They hype the heck out of e=
very big interview they get for their local market. They hope DWS will be t=
he next big interview in their politics interview series.

Ryan: Can any of these times work for 12 May? My calendar for DWS doesn't g=
o that far forward.
1. Live interview scheduled in between 2:00 - 3:00 pm (Pacific Time) with v=
arious breaks in between.

2. A recorded interview between 9:00 - 10:00 am (Pacific Time).

3. A recorded interview between 10:00 - 11:00 am (Pacific Time).

Plus walter for regional awarness
