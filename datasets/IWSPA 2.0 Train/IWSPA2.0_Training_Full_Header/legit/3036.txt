Lewandowski

Called the NYT story untrue

Q: Kasich not endorsing

Trump a unifier.

Need to ensure HRC isn't president

Don't think Kasich or anyone else is willing to have HRC be president

Q: Tone change?

Think American people are really smart. GOP turnout is up while Dem turnout is down

Q: Tax returns? Nothing restricting him of releasing

He is under a routine domain.com. Greta said she wouldn't advise her client to release their returns either

DJT just released PFD, largest of all time. Bernie asked for an extension. That's the difference between the two of them

Cant release taxes while under routine domain.com

Q: Charitable giving?

Its in there. PFD is much more detailed than the tax form

Most charitable giving is under personal account, but also his foundation.

Q: Most of the foundation money is actually from other people, then they disperse it to others

He has given over $100 million to charitable groups over the years

Said he gave $1 million to veterans groups
