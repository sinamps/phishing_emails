The $452 number is off the latest filing which Jessica pulled this afternoon.   There could be many reasons for the differences.   Many times people pull total receipts which is different from total contributions (raised).   Total receipts can include refunds from vendors, etc.   Raised is the proper number to  use.

There are no states in BVF.   It is up to the candidate to include other members.   Not us.   HFA reached out to the states to invite them in, and they worked to sign them up.  We did nothing.   Bernie has shown no interest in doing anything with the states or with BVF period.

Ok, and a couple of follow ups from McClatchy:
They had this number for the 2015 OVF:
$456,024,034
While in your responses earlier you gave:
Obama Victory 2012: $452,851,099
Which one should we use?

And for the Sanders Victory Fund, how many state parties signed onto it? Is it the same 32 or 33 or HVF?

Yes, I don't think we want to go down that path.
