Dear Steven and Stephen,




Have screened the film with our key staffs. Honestly, we would definitely lose money on this one.

Very tough to identify target audience in Japan.




AD/pub     20 M  yen

Print# 5     0.6 M  yen

Other cost   0.5 M  yen




BO         5 M  yen

Film rental   2 M yen  (40%)




Total :  Minus 19.1 M yen




For your reference our HE colleagues did not release the prequel which was NRP in DVD format but only did Digital transmission.



Would like HO decision to NRP.




Sincerely,

Dick
