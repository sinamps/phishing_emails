Good Afternoon

Is. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz available for an interview tomorrow morning with Fernando Espuelas on Matter of Fact?  We tape the show at the Newseum and can do the interview anytime between 9am-11am.  It will take about 10 minutes for the interview and we have a make-up artist on site.

Rep. Wasserman Schultz has been a guest on the show before.  Thanks for your consideration!

Best,

Traci Caldwell
