Says Trump will need less money than traditional candidates

First entrepreneur to go straight into White House

-          Too complicated

-          Doesn't want to open them up to opposition research poking holes

-          Wants to focus instead on creating middle-class jobs

-          Non-material issue to the campaign

-          Optional. Clearly not a legal issue, because IRS would do something
