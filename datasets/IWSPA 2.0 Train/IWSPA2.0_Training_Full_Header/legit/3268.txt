Trump on Fox and friends

Leading HRC in the polls?
- Bernie Sanders says she has bad judgment
- Unlike Sanders, "I will pickup on the emails big league"

HRC criticizing you on guns background checks and guns in schools?
- I don't want guns in classrooms
- But some teachers should have guns
- Trained teachers should have guns

NRA endorsement?
- I was honored.
- Tough endorsement to get

GOP donors opposition?
- Special interests know they won't have access to me
- Pete Ricketts endorsed me. So not whole Ricketts family

NYT story?
- NYT is a failing newspaper
- Dishonest

Self-funding?
- Special interests won't control me
- Helping raise money for down ballot

Bernie Sanders/DWS?
- 30%+ of Sanders voters will support me
- We agree on trade
