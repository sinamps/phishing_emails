We=92re not in disagreement on this. Happy to save us the trouble of having=
 to meet. When I ok=92d the tweet TJ was supposed to run it through the usu=
al process, just like when I approve a press release it still goes to RR2. =
Ultimately Comm can still override thematic changes, but we definitely want=
 the substance to be right. The only issue yesterday was I didn=92t see a r=
eason to get into it in a big group setting, and to Cate=92s domain.com she was=
 poised and professional as usual. But yes, I=92ll reiterate to my team to =
continue to run everything we do through the same process.

Thanks.
