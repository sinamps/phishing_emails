Hi Pablo -
Please let me know when you have time to meet to discuss the surrogate database and getting the talkers list into the database.
I've been trying to connect with someone since User and I met April 26.
I know we all have a lot going on but this is a priority for Amy.
Please let me know when you are available.
I can be available Wednesday, 12-2P or 4-6P; Thursday, 1:30-6P.
Thank you in advance.
Jenn

Hey Jenn - I can't take the surrogate piece onto my plate right now.
Per User - Pablo will handle for comms. Since he does booking already, it's a natural fit to do surrogate piece.
Thanks
