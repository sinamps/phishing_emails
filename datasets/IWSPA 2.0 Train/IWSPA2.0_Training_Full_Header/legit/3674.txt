We have the full schedule. Should we just email it to the reporters? 

Thanks,

Looping others. We have reporters asking where this is tomorrow, specifically NBC/MSNBC and Politico, they want to cover the Chair's speech. There's no advisory. It seems like we should be able to advise the Chair's speech. So if there's a press plan on the ground for the meeting itself, please share because we don't have anything to give these reporters.
