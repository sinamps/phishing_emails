The research teams at Organizationand HFA are going to join forces on media monitoring starting Monday morning. Corinne can tell you more, but basically this means you will be getting national TV clips in real time and we won't have to send around the articles about Trump ourselves.

Our inboxes may get a bit more hairy but comms and text research will be relieved of a chunk of the media monitoring work which is GREAT! The video team will be even busier so buy them beer, donuts, bagles....

Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

Corinne will give more thorough information/instructions on Monday.
