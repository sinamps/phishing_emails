Ike's assistant Marisol said nothing about Drew's folks being included. 

Just off with Jeanne Newman and Julien, who will send agreements (having received permission from ABC to do so), but I don't have yet and won't have a chance to review before this call, so I think we're just listening. 
And perhaps for that, it just being us might be best. 

Mm
