Subject: ALERT: Madeleine Morgenstern from Washington Examiner
Importance: High

Hey everybody - heads up.

Someone named Madeleine Morgenstern with the Washington Examiner (a right-wing rag based in DC) has been emailing the Organizationand state parties asking for a list of delegates and their personal/contact information.

We do not provide personal information or contact information about delegates, especially not to right-wing media outlets.

We would advise you to ignore this inquiry. I've included a copy of the email that was forwarded to us from one of the state parties.

Thank you!
Eric
