Hey Rich,

We route our signal through DCI (domain.com<<<link>>>) and they can make the connections for you. I know they are on the switch, I'm not sure what other options they can offer. Give them a call and tell them that you're looking to connect to Organizationstudio and they'll be able to help. Thanks!

Mitch
