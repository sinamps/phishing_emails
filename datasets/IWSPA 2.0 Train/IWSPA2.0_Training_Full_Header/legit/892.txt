How about Rep. Ted Lieu from CA?
He's been a leader on cybersecurity (was featured on 60 min exposing vulnerabilities in the global mobile network that would allow hacker to access gov. cell phones), president of the Democratic Freshman class, is an airforce veteran and served in Operation Pacific Haven.
