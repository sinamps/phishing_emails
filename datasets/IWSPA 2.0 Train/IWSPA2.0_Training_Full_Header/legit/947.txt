Hi Gian,  I just had the first interview via skype with Sundararajan, I would send him to the next step of interview.The good thing is that his family lives in India meaning that he would not mind to be based in India up to 70% of the time. He is currently on a yearly package of SGD 48.750 and an annual bonus of 8.19% of his current salary, and he could start working with us next week if needed. Ale, when could you have a skype call with him? Thanks,    Daniel MagliettaChief of HT Singapore Representative Office user@domain: +6591273560www.domain.com HT SrlUOB Plaza 180 Raffles PlaceLevel 35-25 Singapore 048624 From: Daniel Maglietta <user@domain>
