Emad,

io direi di rispondere

since the payments are related to invoices issued on 2015 and 2013, we are not authorized to confirm and perform the training until we have received the amount and the TAX receipts as reported in the below table.

Dimmi se vuoi l'offerta.

Hi Mesfer

Thanks for your fast re-action.

About the maintenance, let me suggest to you to consider the Attack Vecktor Service fee as well to allow the customer to be more powerfull in it's action on infect the target. ( We are speaking about the 0 Day domain.com). Based on our experience this service
 is really appreciate from the customer point of view. But this will be you final decision. Let me know your final decision and I will revert to you with the quotation asap.

I'm confident to recevied the pending amount as per your suggestion, really appreciate.

Right now I can't confirm you any available dates due the fact we need to check with the department dedicated.

Hi Emad,

Thanks for your email.

Send me an official quotation for the yearly maintenance only.

For the deducted TAX amount, I�m following up with our finance and you will receive it before this Thursday. What I need from you is a confirmation that your team is available in your side to conduct the advanced training in Italy within the last two weeks
 of Jun as per our client�s preference.

Best Regards,

Dear Mr. Mesfer,
I�m Emad Shehata, nice to meet you.
As per the e-mail sent by our Sales Manager (see you here below) regarding the still open financial issue, I'd like to inform you that the Yearly Maintenance and
 the domain.com Service (now called Attack Vector Service) will expire on 31 May 2014.



The delivery was performed on January 2013, and expiration date should have been on January 2015 but, agreed by the parties, was extended until 31 of May 2014.



After the expiration the customer will able to use the product and receive data from targets but not to make new infections, not to receive new updates not the
 ticket support.
Based on the agreement we have in place, I would summarize the costs of the maintenance renewal fee and the Attack Vector Service fee:



Yearly Maintenance fee                              � 114.000,00                                      ( 20% of � 570.000,00 that it was the Total Amount of the
 PO)
Attack Vecktor Service fee                          �  50.000,00                                      (as reported in the original offer signed by you)
Total Amount                                                   � 164.000,00 




Please let me know if you need a formal Offer in order to arrange your PO before the expiration date.



Best regards

Dear Mr. Mesfer,




my name is Marco Bettini, I'm the Sales Manager at HT.




With this email I inform you that Mostapha resigned and left the company last week.

For the future communications, please keep my colleague Emad Shehata or myself as reference. You can find our contact details below.




Regarding the advanced training for GID, please give few days to check the availability of the team.




Before confirm the training we need you to solve the financial issue. I'm summarizing the situation of the last invoices:




Invoice Nr.

Total Amount

Amount Paid

Amount Due

Tax 5%

157/2012

� 370.500,00

� 351.975,00

� 18.525,00

� 18.525,00

045/2013

� 5.850,00

� 1.950,00




Balance without tax

� 34.350,00

Balance  with TAX

� 12.450,00




For each invoice you can find the amount paid and the amount that has not been yet paid.

Two options:

1) If you apply the 5% of tax, the amount that you have to pay is Euro 12.450,00.  A TAX official receipt must be provided. 

2) otherwise our domain.com is Euro 34.350,00.




Our Financial Department informed us that it's mandatory to receive payments and documents before arranging the Advanced Training.




Please keep us informed.




Best Regards,




Marco Bettini

Dear Mesfer,

Hope you are doing well.

I just got a call from our financial department and unfortunately the situation regarding the official receipt for the tax deduction is becoming
 critical.

Can you please update me and advise how to proceed?

Thank you and best regards,

Mostapha

Dear Mesfer,

Thank you in advance for the final payment.




As I told you before, this deduction will be rejected from our financial department without an
official receipt. BTW, why is it 15% this time and not 5%?

Anyway, would you be available for a call tomorrow morning?

Thank you,

Mostapha
