New Security Feature - Sign-In Protection

We recommend that 
    you sign up for Lloyds TSB  new Online Banking security feature, which helps



    protect your account from unauthorized users.

How does this new security feature work?

    Sign-In Protection adds an extra level of verification to the sign-in 
    process -- it's like putting a second
 lock on your door. Any attempts to 
    access your Online Banking accounts from a computer we don't 
recognize will 
    be prevented unless the correct answer to one of your personal verification questions is
 given.
