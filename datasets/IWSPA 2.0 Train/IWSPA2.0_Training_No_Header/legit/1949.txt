Dear Tim,
Here are some suggestions for potential reviewers of a Santer et al. 
IJoC submission on issues related to the consistency between modeled and 
observed atmospheric temperature trends. None of the suggested reviewers 
have been involved in the recent "focus group" that has discussed 
problems with the Douglass et al. IJoC paper.

committee on "Reconciling observations of global temperature change" 
(2000). Email: user@domain
2. Qiang Fu, organization of Washington. Expert on atmospheric radiation, 
dynamics, radiosonde and satellite data. Published 2004 Nature paper and 
2005 GRL paper dealing with issues related to global and tropical 
temperature trends. Email: user@domain
3. Gabi Hegerl, organization of Edinburgh. Expert on detection and 
attribution of externally-forced climate change. Co-Convening Lead
