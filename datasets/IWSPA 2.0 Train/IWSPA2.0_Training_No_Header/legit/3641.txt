LONDON -- BP Amoco Plc, the world's No. 3 publicly traded oil
company, and Ford Motor Co. said they will give Princeton
organization $20 million over 10 years to study ways to reduce
carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. BP said it will give
$15 million. Ford, the world's second-biggest automaker, is
donating $5 million. The gift is part of a partnership between the
companies aimed at addressing concerns about climate change.
Carbon dioxide is the most common of the greenhouse gases believed
to contribute to global warming.
London-based BP said it plans to give $85 million in the next
decade to universities in the U.S. and U.K. to study environmental
and energy issues. In the past two years, the company has pledged
$40 million to Cambridge organization, $20 million to the organization
of California at Berkeley and $10 million to the organization of
Colorado at Boulder.
