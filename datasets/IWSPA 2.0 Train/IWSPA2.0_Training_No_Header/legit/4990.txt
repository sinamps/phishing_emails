Confidentiality Level : INTERPOL For official use only
Dear Lucia , 
We are happy to see you during INTERPOL General Assembly Exhibition in Monaco.
As you are probably aware, each year all General Assembly participants receive  the cases with a GA program, information package and other documents. We used to add in the case some equipment/ small devices which
are very useful for the participants
I would like to know if organization , as our partner,  is interested in sponsoring  this year the electric adapters or/and  USB key which will be distributed in the cases ( to all delegates) with organization
Logo and the General Assembly logo. Last year the approximatively cost of providing adapters was 12 000€.
You are also welcome to propose, if you wish, other possible commercial objects to be included in the case and distribute (under the same conditions with organization and INTERPOL’s GA logos).
Please keep in mind that the device needs to be very useful and rather small.
Could you advice rather soon as we put on hold this option for other exhibitors pending your decision.
Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need further details.
Thank you very much
Kind regards
